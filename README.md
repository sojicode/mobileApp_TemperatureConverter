## Mobile Application  - Temperature Converter

### Requirements

* The app should allow the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions. Conversion is selected using Radio Buttons. Fahrenheit-to-Celsius should be the default if there is no saved preference.

* User the following formulae for conversion:
> - F to C: (F – 32.0) / 1.8 Example (75F): (75.0 – 32.0) / 1.8 = 23.9C
> - C to F: (C * 1.8) + 32 Example (15C): (15.0 * 1.8) + 32.0 = 59F

* The temperature value (the value to be converted) should be entered by the user. Values can be positive or negative. Only numeric whole or decimal values should be allowed.

* Pressing a Convert button should generate the converted temperature value and display it on the screen. All converted values should be displayed out to 1 decimal place only.

* All conversion operations and their results should be added to the “history” – a list of converted values. The history of converted values must be scrollable and displayed with the most recent conversions at the top of the list.

* Examples:
> - F to C: 75.0 ➔ 23.9
> - C to F: 15.0 ➔ 59.0

* Pressing the “Clear” button will clear the conversion history.

* The Constraint Layout must be used.

* You do need a separate Landscape layout for this assignment.

* The app must look and act consistently in either portrait or landscape orientation. No data content should be lost upon rotation (i.e., the current conversion, the current calculated results, and the conversion history should be maintained upon rotation).
